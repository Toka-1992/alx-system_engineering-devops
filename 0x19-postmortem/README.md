### Postmortem Report: Outage and Resolution of Customer Service Portal

## Issue Summary:

On March 1st, 2023, between 2:00 PM and 5:00 PM EST, our company's online shopping platform experienced a three-hour outage that resulted in significant disruptions to user activity. The root cause was identified as a bug in the system's codebase, leading to an unexpected server crash and service interruption. Approximately 60% of users attempting to access the platform were affected, resulting in lost revenue and negative customer experience.

## Timeline:

* 2:00 PM EST: The issue was first detected through a monitoring alert indicating a sudden drop in server response times.
* The engineering team was notified and began investigating the issue, initially assuming it was a traffic spike or a hardware failure.
* The team realized that the issue was related to a codebase bug causing unexpected server crashes, leading to the outage.
* The team attempted various debugging paths, including server reboots and software updates, which did not resolve the issue.
* 3:30 PM EST: The incident was escalated to senior management and the company's CEO was notified of the situation.
* The engineering team worked with the product team and senior management to develop and implement a fix for the bug.
* 5:00 PM EST: The issue was resolved, and the platform was back online, with monitoring put in place to ensure that no similar issues occur in the future.

## Root cause and resolution:

The root cause of the outage was a bug in the codebase of the online shopping platform, leading to unexpected server crashes and service interruption. The bug was related to a new feature that had recently been implemented but not thoroughly tested, leading to an unexpected impact on the system's stability. To resolve the issue, the engineering team worked with the product team to develop and implement a patch that addressed the underlying bug, which was tested extensively before being deployed to the production environment. Additionally, the team implemented enhanced monitoring and testing procedures to catch similar issues in the future.

## Corrective and preventative measures:
To prevent similar issues from occurring in the future, our company will take the following corrective and preventative measures:

1 * Conduct a thorough review of the codebase for all recent feature additions to ensure they have been thoroughly tested.
2 * Implement a formal testing and quality assurance process to ensure that all changes to the system are validated before being deployed to the production environment.
3  * Enhance monitoring and alerting mechanisms to quickly detect and respond to any unexpected service interruptions.
Develop and implement a disaster recovery plan to minimize the impact of any future outages on the platform and its users.
Schedule a review of our infrastructure's hardware and software components to ensure they are up to date and meet the demands of our growing user base.
Schedule a post-mortem meeting to discuss the lessons learned from this outage and identify opportunities for improvement in our processes and systems.

In conclusion, while the outage was unfortunate and had a significant impact on our platform's users and revenue, it provided us with a valuable opportunity to learn and improve. By identifying and addressing the root cause of the issue, implementing corrective and preventative measures, and conducting a review of our processes, we are confident that we can minimize the likelihood of similar incidents in the future and ensure the highest level of service to our customers.
